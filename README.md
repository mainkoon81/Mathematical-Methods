# Mathematical-Methods

## 1. Differential Equation
> How do you **design**
 - a boat that doesn't tip over as it bobs in the water,
 - the suspension system of a car for a smooth ride,
 - circuits that tune to the correct frequencies in a cell phone?

> How do you **model**
 - the growth of antibiotic resistant bacteria,
 - gene expression,
 - online purchasing trends?

__[The answer]:__ Differential Equations. They are the language of the models we use to describe the world around us. We will develop the mathematical tools needed to solve linear differential equations. In the case of nonlinear differential equations, we will employ graphical methods and approximation to understand solutions.

## 2. Time Series
Time series is a dataset **collected through time**. Now, since we are doing sampling with adjacent points in time, we naturally introduce a correlation into the system, which means the classical, statistical inference might not work in this setting.  
> Some time series from 'astsa' package in R
 - jj (Johnson and Johnson Quarterly Earnings for 84 quarters)
 - flu (Pneumonia and influenza deaths in the U.S. per 10,000 people Monthly for 11 years)
 - globtemp (Land-ocean mean temperature deviations for the years 1880-2015)
 - globtempl (Land only mean temperature deviations for the years 1880-2015)
 - star (Variable Star: The magnitude of a star taken at midnight for 600 consecutive days )  
> Stationarity
 - In a stationary time series, there is no systematic change in **mean** (no trend), no systematic change in **variance**, and no **fluctuation**(periodic variations).. so..basically, the properties of one section of a data are much like the properties of the other sections of the data.
 
 
 
 
> ACF (Auto Cov Function?)
 - If we characterize time series as a realization of a **stochastic process**,  

> ACF (Auto Corr Function?)
