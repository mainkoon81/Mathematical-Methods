## 1. Differential Equation
> How do you **design**
 - a boat that doesn't tip over as it bobs in the water,
 - the suspension system of a car for a smooth ride,
 - circuits that tune to the correct frequencies in a cell phone?

> How do you **model**
 - the growth of antibiotic resistant bacteria,
 - gene expression,
 - online purchasing trends?

__[The answer]:__ Differential Equations. They are the language of the models we use to describe the world around us. We will develop the mathematical tools needed to solve linear differential equations. In the case of nonlinear differential equations, we will employ graphical methods and approximation to understand solutions.

## 2. Time Series
Time series is a dataset **collected through time**. Sampling adjacent points in time introduce a correlation.
